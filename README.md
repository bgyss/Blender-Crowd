# Blender Crowd

Blender Crowd is a proposed Blender-native platform for authoring, simulating,
editing, caching, and rendering autonomous character crowds.

The project is designed around a high-performance deterministic simulation core,
with Blender serving as the authoring, debugging, layout, and rendering
environment. Geometry Nodes is a presentation and procedural-authoring layer,
not the authoritative simulator.

The canonical product and engineering contract is:

- [Blender Crowd 1.0 architecture and MVP](docs/blender-crowd-1.0.md)

The first release is intentionally focused: build a trustworthy pedestrian-crowd
pipeline for 1,000 interactive agents before expanding into semantic activities,
combat, traffic, motion matching, or 100,000-agent backgrounds.
