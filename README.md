# Blender Crowd

Blender Crowd is a proposed Blender-native platform for authoring, simulating,
editing, caching, and rendering autonomous character crowds.

The project is designed around a high-performance deterministic simulation core,
with Blender serving as the authoring, debugging, layout, and rendering
environment. Geometry Nodes is a presentation and procedural-authoring layer,
not the authoritative simulator.

The canonical product and engineering contract is:

- [Blender Crowd 1.0 architecture and MVP](docs/blender-crowd-1.0.md)

The industrial capability target and its traceability to the delivery sequence
are documented in:

- [Industrial crowd capability and Blender integration roadmap](docs/industrial-crowd-capability-roadmap.md)
- [Milestone contract index](docs/milestones/README.md)

Research informing the avoidance, social-attention, scale, and animation-tier
decisions is summarized in:

- [Crowd simulation research synthesis](docs/crowd-simulation-research-2026.md)

The first release is intentionally focused: build a trustworthy pedestrian-crowd
pipeline for 1,000 interactive agents before expanding into semantic activities,
combat, traffic, motion matching, or 100,000-agent backgrounds. Those later
capabilities are deferred, not discarded: the milestone suite carries the
project from the 1.0 proof toward a Golaem-class Blender production workflow,
MASSIVE-style authorable agency, and an eventual Blender ecosystem/mainline
integration proposal backed by production evidence.
